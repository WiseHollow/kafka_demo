# Kafka Demo Using SpringBoot

## Why?
I wanted to study **basic Kafka implementation**, and the provided Spring libraries make it quite simple to get started. Hopefully this example project helps anyone who's curious about learning Apache Kafka. 

### Requirements
1. Follow the quickstart guide for running Kafka locally on your machine.
2. A way of sending POST & GET requests to rest API. Examples: Postman, Insomnia
